                         To ensure the best performance for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster workloads on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), it's important to size your volume performance units (VPUs) appropriately.
                         Here are some general guidelines:
                         **Test or proof of concept environment:** 100 GB, and 20 to 30 VPUs.
                         **Basic environment:** 500 GB, and 60 VPUs.
                         **Heavy production environment:** More than 500 GB, and 100 or more VPUs.
                         Consider reserving additional VPUs to provide sufficient capacity for updates and scaling activities.
